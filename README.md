The Advanced Calculator App is designed to cater to the needs of students, professionals, and anyone requiring a feature-rich calculator. It supports basic arithmetic operations, advanced mathematical functions, trigonometry, logarithms, and more. This app is a handy tool for complex calculations, saving you time and effort.

## Features

- Perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Calculate advanced functions (square root, exponentiation, factorial)
- Evaluate trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent)
- Compute logarithmic functions (natural logarithm, base 10 logarithm)
- Handle complex numbers and operations
- Memory functions for storing and recalling values

## Installation

To run the Advanced Calculator App locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/advanced-calculator-app.git
```

2. Change into the project directory:

```
cd advanced-calculator-app
```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to access the calculator.

## Usage

Once you have the app open in your web browser, you can use the calculator to perform various operations:

- **Basic Arithmetic:** Use the number buttons and operation symbols (+, -, *, /) to perform basic arithmetic operations.

- **Advanced Functions:** Explore the advanced mathematical functions available in the app, such as square root, exponentiation, and factorial.

- **Trigonometric Functions:** Access trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan) by selecting the appropriate buttons. The calculator supports both degrees and radians modes.

- **Logarithmic Functions:** Calculate logarithmic values using the natural logarithm (ln) and base 10 logarithm (log10) buttons.

- **Complex Numbers:** The calculator provides support for complex numbers and operations involving them.

- **Memory Functions:** Utilize memory buttons (M+, M-, MR, MC) to store and recall values.

## Mathematical Functions

The Advanced Calculator App supports the following mathematical functions:

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/)
- Advanced functions: square root (sqrt), exponentiation (^), factorial (!)
